    "Netflix is a subscription-based streaming platform that allows users to watch movies and TV shows without advertisements. One of the reasons behind the popularity of Netflix is its recommendation system. Its recommendation system recommends movies and TV shows based on the userâ€™s interest. If you are a Data Science student and want to learn how to create a Netflix recommendation system, this project is for you. This project will take you through how to build a Netflix recommendation system using Python."
